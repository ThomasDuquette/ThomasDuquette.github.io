Welcome to my website!

My name is Thomas, and I am a 5th-year undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Universit√© de Moncton. I am passionate about the field of robotics and currently work at the Dynamium Research Laboratory.

On this website, I aim to share informative publications about the concepts I have learned during my research. I will regularly update the content to keep you informed about my latest discoveries.

The site is divided into two main sections: "Publications" and "About." In the "Publications" section, you will find accessible articles that will enhance your understanding of complex robotics concepts. The "About" section provides more details about my background, interests, and motivations.

I would also like to mention that this website is available in English for those who prefer that language.

I hope you have an enjoyable visit, and I trust you will find valuable and insightful information here. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thank you for being here!

Thomas
