My name is Thomas, and I am a fifth-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Universit√© de Moncton. Passionate about the field of robotics, I am currently working within the Dynamium research laboratory.

On this website, I aim to share informative publications about the concepts I have learned during my research. I will regularly provide updates to keep you informed about my latest discoveries.

I wish you a pleasant visit, and I hope you find interesting and enriching information here. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thank you for being here!

Thomas
