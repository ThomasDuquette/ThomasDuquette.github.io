In this section, you will find information about me, the website, and the Dynamium lab where I plan to pursue my graduate studies.

#### About Me

Welcome to the world of Thomas Duquette, a passionate mechanical engineering and robotics enthusiast striving to make a mark in the field. As a fifth-year student, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, driven by a passion for mathematics, engineering, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. I also aspire to continue my academic journey at the Université de Moncton, pursuing a Master's degree within the Dynamium lab.

My area of expertise lies within the captivating realm of manipulator robotics, with a specific focus on motion planning. I aspire to master this field and push its boundaries further. This summer, I have the fortunate opportunity to intern at Dynamium, the robotics lab at Université de Moncton, immersing myself in cutting-edge research and honing my skills in robotic arm path planning, particularly in collision detection and avoidance.

But my journey doesn't end there. I have been privileged to engage in three research internships, each of which has enhanced my knowledge and skills. In 2021, I explored the application of carsharing technology in the unique landscape of New Brunswick. The following year, I delved into the optimization of a regenerative organic Rankine cycle, improving its efficiency and environmental impact. In 2023, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of advanced path planning algorithms for robotic arms at Dynamium.

My dedication and efforts have been recognized through various accolades. Not only have I achieved the highest academic honors in my third and fourth years of university, but I have also been honored with the Academic Merit Certificate five times, demonstrating my consistent commitment to excellence.

Looking ahead, my vision is to become a robotics engineer who contributes to the development of software solutions for optimization. With an entrepreneurial spirit, I aspire to establish my own business, driving innovation in the field. I am also open to contributing my skills and expertise to reputable organizations that share my passion for transforming the world through robotics.

If you are a recruiter or a professional seeking a skilled and dynamic engineer, I invite you to explore my website and discover the blend of talent, ambition, and determination that defines Thomas Duquette. Together, let's embark on an exciting journey to shape the future of robotics and engineering.
