On October 20, 2021, Dynamium, officially named the _Laboratoire des systèmes dynamiques de l'Université de Moncton_, was founded and received institutional recognition from the Université de Moncton. This new mechanical engineering lab will focus on achieving high quality physical human-robot interaction.

The founding members of Dynamium are Marise Gallant, Nancy Black, Roger Boudreau, and André Gallant who will be its director.

We are very happy start this journey together and we look forward to writing about all our projects soon!
